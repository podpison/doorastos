      'Doors from China are quite light and thin. Their weight often does not exceed 20-30 kg, and the thickness of the metal sheet barely reaches 0.5 mm. When pressed, the canvas flexes and springs.',

    description: [
      'The doors of domestic production are filled with certified materials that have passed all the necessary test tests. The most commonly used foamed polyurethane, basalt or mineral plate. These materials do not allow cold wind, moisture and noise to enter the house, providing reliable protection.',
      'Chinese counterparts often turn out to be "hollow" and as a filler, you can only count on corrugated cardboard, which is not packed tightly enough. All the shortcomings of this material can be noticeably felt in the cold season of the year. The door does not protect against drafts and frost, it lets cold air into the house and extraneous noise from the street.',

    heading: 'Design & Finish',
    description: [
      'Chinese-made doors have a quite attractive design, but if you look closely at the door leaf, you can see a poor-quality superimposed pattern created by a thin polymer film. During operation, such a door quickly loses attractive data. In addition, the design of all doors is typical and not unique.',
      'Manufacturers from Russia choose materials of decent quality as finishes, which are resistant to various influences. They create a presentable appearance for the finished product. The buyer can choose a beautiful canvas with decorative elements made of chromed metal, glass, a mirror surface or carvings on a wooden base. The choice of design solutions is very large!',

    heading: 'Lifetime',
    description: [
      'Chinese doors are of poor quality. Accordingly, the service life of such structures is short. Many people call metal doors from China disposable, which is quite true.',
      'Sturdy metal doors from the Russian Federation will last for several decades, and even years later they will not lose their performance. Many citizens change such doors to new designs, only to change the already bored design, and the old doors, which have not lost their appearance and their protective qualities, are reinstalled in other rooms.',

    heading: 'Conclusion',
    description: [
      'Chinese doors are not a way to protect the house even from drafts, so you should not even count on protecting the house from breaking and entering thieves. Such doors can be installed in an office located on the heated floor of a high-rise building where a security service operates. Installing low-quality doors in residential buildings is a very unwise decision.',
      'It is not worth saving money on the purchase of such an important structure, the main function of which is to protect the house. It is better to spend money once, but to purchase a high-quality metal entrance door that will perfectly cope with the tasks set and will last for a dozen years. You can choose a reliable steel door of a domestic manufacturer on our website.'
